    "- All channels are correlated\n",

    "- Data requirements are unrealistic\n",

    "### What Practitioners Should Do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Don't use dual-adstock with λ > 0.95**\n",
    "2. **Always check diagnostics** (DW, Ljung-Box)\n",
    "3. **Use shorter retention** (λ = 0.5-0.8 for \"medium-term\")\n",
    "4. **Triangulate evidence** (MMM + surveys + experiments)\n",
    "5. **Report uncertainty honestly** (ranges, not point estimates)\n",
    "6. **Be skeptical of vendor claims**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions to Ask Vendors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What's your Durbin-Watson statistic?\n",
    "- What retention rate are you using?\n",
    "- Can I see residual diagnostics?\n",
